# Project name: "Learning to learn"

## What topics does the project cover
This project describes the most relevant approaches to learning in any area of ​​life. Here are various authors and their teaching methods, research data and historical summaries, links to helpful videos and a must-read book. Often, even the most difficult tasks have advantages - knowledge in them is deeper. Learning something new is not only useful, but also entertaining. And it turns out that only 20 hours are enough to master a new skill, as one of the videos above says.

## Features of the second design work
The second project is a logical continuation of the first project, supplemented with new blocks using new skills acquired in the last course. The cardinal difference is the use of file organization according to the BEM system. Unlike the first project, animations are used here, such as rotating elements and fading links based on duration and color saturation. Structuring files according to BEM shows that it is practical, intuitive, and allows you to easily return to the created elements for further manipulations. The project taught how to create and use repeating elements. This greatly simplifies writing code, unloads it, saves time spent on repetitions.
